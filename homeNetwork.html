            <h3 class="h-3">Introduction:</h3>
            <p class="text">A home network is a group of devices that are connected together to share resources, such as an internet connection, printers, and files. A typical home network consists of a modem, a router, and a variety of wired and wireless devices, such as computers, smartphones, and tablets.The modem links the network to the internet service provider (ISP), while the router manages traffic and assigns local IP addresses to each device.</p>

    <div>
        <h3 class="h-3">Types of Home Networks:</h3>
        <p>There are several types of home networks, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The most common types of home networks include:

            <ul>
                <li><b class="b">Wired Network:</b> A wired network uses Ethernet cables to connect devices to the network. It provides a fast and reliable connection, but can be difficult to set up and may require drilling holes in walls.</li>
                <li><b class="b">Wireless Network:</b> A wireless network uses radio waves to connect devices to the network. It is easy to set up and provides mobility, but can be slower and less reliable than a wired network.</li>
                <li><b class="b">Hybrid Network:</b> A hybrid network combines wired and wireless connections to provide the best of both worlds. It can be more complex to set up, but provides the flexibility of wireless connectivity with the speed and reliability of a wired network.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>


    <div>
        <h3 class="h-3">Hardware Requirements:</h3>
        <p>When setting up a home network, it is important to understand the various components that make up the network. These components include:

            <ul>
                <li><b class="b">Modem:</b> A modem is a device that connects your home network to the internet. It receives data from your internet service provider (ISP) and converts it into a form that can be used by my network.</li>
                <li><b class="b">Router:</b>A router is a device that directs traffic between devices on your network and the internet. It assigns IP addresses to devices, manages network security, and can also provide wireless connectivity.</li>
                <li><b class="b">Switch:</b>A switch is a device that allows multiple devices to connect to a network using Ethernet cables. It can be used to connect wired devices, such as desktop computers or game consoles.</li>
                <li><b class="b">Wireless Access Point (WAP):</b>A WAP is a device that provides wireless connectivity to devices my network. It allows devices to connect to the network without the need for cables.</li>
                <li><b class="b">Ethernet Cables:</b>Ethernet cables are used to connect devices to the network. They provide a stable and reliable connection and are essential for devices that do not have wireless capabilities. When choosing Ethernet cables, it is important to consider factors such as length, speed, and quality. Cat5e and Cat6 cables are the most common types of Ethernet cables used in home networks.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>


    <div>
        <h3 class="h-3">Network Interface Cards:</h3>
        <p>Network Interface Cards (NICs) are used to connect devices to the network. They are essential for devices that do not have built-in network capabilities, such as desktop computers. When choosing NICs, it is important to consider factors such as compatibility with the operating system and network speed. Some popular NIC brands include Intel, TP-Link, and Asus.</p>
    </div>


    <div>
        <h3 class="h-3">Software Requirements:</h3>
        <p>When setting up a home network, it is important to ensure that your software meets the necessary requirements. This section will cover the two main software requirements for setting up a home network.
             <ul>
                <li><b class="b">Operating:</b>The first software requirement for setting up a home network is having a compatible operating system. Most modern operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, come with built-in network functionality that allows you to connect to the internet and other devices on your network. <br><br>

                    It is important to ensure that your operating system is up-to-date with the latest secu rity patches and updates. This will help ensure that your network is secure and protected against potential threats. </li> <br>
                <li><b class="b">Network Drivers:</b>The second software requirement for setting up a home network is having the necessary network drivers installed on your computer. Network drivers are software programs that allow your computer to communicate with your network hardware, such as your router or modem. <br><br>

                    Most modern operating systems come with built-in network drivers, but it is important to ensure that they are up-to-date with the latest versions. This will help ensure that your network hardware is functioning properly and that you are getting the best possible network performance. <br> <br>
                    
                    If you are using older hardware or a custom-built computer, you may need to download and install the necessary network drivers from the manufacturer’s website. It is important to ensure that you download the correct drivers for your specific hardware and operating system.</li>
                
             </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3 class="h-3">Setting Up the Hardware:</h3>
        <p> Setting up the hardware is the first step in creating a home network. This section covers the three main hardware components needed for a typical home network: the modem, the router, and the devices that connect to the network.
          <ul>
            <li><b class="b">Connecting the Modem:</b>To connect to the internet, a modem is required. The modem connects to the internet service provider (ISP) and converts the signal to a form that can be used by the router. <br>
                <br>
                1.Connect the modem to the ISP’s network port using the provided cable. <br>
                2. Power on the modem and wait for it to establish a connection with the ISP. <br>
                3.Check the modem’s status lights to ensure that it has successfully connected to the ISP. 
            
            </li>



            <li><b class="b">Operating:</b></li>
            <li><b class="b">Operating:</b></li>
