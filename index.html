        <h3 class="h-3">Introduction:</h3>
        <p class="text">A home network is a vital component of modern households, enabling seamless connectivity and resource sharing among various devices. At its core, a home network typically includes a modem, which connects to the internet service provider, and a router, which serves as the central hub for the network. Connected to the router are a variety of devices, both wired and wireless, such as computers, smartphones, smart TVs, and printers</p>

        <h3 class="h-3">Types of Home Networks:</h3>
        <p>There are several types of home networks, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The most common types of home networks include:

            <ul>
                <li><b class="b">Wired Network:</b> A wired network uses Ethernet cables to connect devices to the network. It provides a fast and reliable connection, but can be difficult to set up and may require drilling holes in walls.</li>
                <li><b class="b">Wireless Network:</b> A wireless network uses radio waves to connect devices to the network. It is easy to set up and provides mobility, but can be slower and less reliable than a wired network.</li>
                <li><b class="b">Hybrid Network:</b> A hybrid network combines wired and wireless connections to provide the best of both worlds. It can be more complex to set up, but provides the flexibility of wireless connectivity with the speed and reliability of a wired network.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
